### Hosting Notes

- **Vercel Support**: Vercel does allow serverless functions for backend operations. If backend is required, you can leverage Vercel's serverless function support, but note that extensive backend usage may exceed free tier limits.

## Backend Considerations

While the project aims to avoid backend for cost-efficiency, here are some points to consider if future features require backend support: 💻💡🤔

1. **Serverless Functions**: Vercel provides serverless functions that can handle API calls and small-scale backend logic.
2. **External APIs**: Utilize third-party APIs for features like contact forms, email services, or analytics.
3. **Static Generation**: Leverage static site generation (SSG) in Next.js to pre-render content and reduce the need for runtime backend operations.
4. **Data Storage**: If storage is needed, consider using client-side storage or free-tier options from Firebase or Supabase.
